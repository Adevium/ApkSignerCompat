# ApkSignerCompat

ApkSigner for Android

Fork of [revanced-library](https://github.com/ReVanced/revanced-library) that only retains the part for signing apks. It uses [MuntashirAkon's apksig](https://github.com/MuntashirAkon/apksig-android) instead of the official one for compatibility with older versions of Android.
